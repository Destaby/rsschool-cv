My name is # Nick Rudyk  
You can contact me via email *rudik.nick.nick@gmail.com* or [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/nick.ryduk).  
I'd like to become more experienced in programming. Hope, this course will help me become stronger.  
I have great knowledge of **JavaScript**, **ReactJS** and **NodeJS**. I also know much about _html_, _css_, _expressjs_ and _django_.  
Here are my latest code examples: [front-end app](https://github.com/Destaby/Chuck-Norris-Jokes), [server](https://github.com/Destaby/Useless-Server).  
I've watched many videos about programming and I also have acquired knowledge from [NodeJS course](https://habr.com/ru/post/485294/) and [JavaScript course](https://habr.com/ru/post/464023/).  
Now I study at the KPI University and I'm in my second year.  
I also watch many videos in English and often speak it with other people. So, I hope my English is good.
