            I'd like to become more experienced in programming. Hope, this
            course will help me become stronger. <br />
            I have great knowledge of JavaScript, ReactJS and NodeJS. I also
            know much about html, css, expressjs and django. <br />
            Here are my latest code examples:
            <a
              href="https://github.com/Destaby/Chuck-Norris-Jokes"
              target="_blank"
              >front-end app</a
            >,
            <a href="https://github.com/Destaby/Useless-Server" target="_blank"
              >server</a
            >. <br />
            I've watched many videos about programming and I also have acquired
            knowledge from
            <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/485294/" target="_blank"
              >NodeJS course</a
            >
            and
            <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/464023/" target="_blank"
              >JavaScript course</a
            >. <br />
            Now I study at the KPI University and I'm in my second year. <br />
            I also watch many videos in English and often speak it with other
            people. So, I hope my English is good.
